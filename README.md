Nederlandse Rijksbegroting Visualisatie / Dutch Budget Visualisation
============

This is a fork of the US Budget Visualisation project by Solomon Kahn. I created a Perl script which converts the Dutch budget data (http://opendata.rijksbegroting.nl) into csv files which can be used by the visualisation code. Furthermore, some changes were made to the javascript code to accommodate the Dutch data and the website was translated into Dutch.

The result can be seen at http://rijksbegroting.ddo.nl.
